    The Jenkins DFCli Plugin allows for easy integration between Jenkins and the DFCli Platform.
    This integration allows your build jobs to deploy artifacts and resolve dependencies to and from Distroface, and
    then have them linked to the build job that created them. It also allows you to scan your artifacts and builds with
    DFCli Xray and distribute your software package to remote locations using DFCli Distribution.
    This is all achieved by the plugin by wrapping DFCli CLI. Any DFCli CLI command can be executed from within your
    Jenkins Pipeline job using the DFCli Plugin.
